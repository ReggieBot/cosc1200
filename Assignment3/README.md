Assignment 3
Professor Tauhid

Program Introduction:

This program was made for Assignment 3. It includes 4 seperate
methods which each relate to topics we've explored in class.
These topics include the following:
    - Method Definition
    - Method Overloading
    - Array as Parameters
    - Recursion

I've created a terminal-based menu in the main class, built off of the menu I created in our first in-class-exercise. This menu allows the user to choose which method to explore, that method will the be called using a switch case.

No external libraries were used, and the only imported library is the java.Util.Scanner class. This is a part of the standard JDK and does not need additional installs (as I'm sure you know). 

This was a fun project. And although the criteria doesn't stipulate that we create a menu, I wanted to include one for ease of use, not to mention, I enjoy extra programming.
