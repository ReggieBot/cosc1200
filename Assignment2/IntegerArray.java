// Assignment 2
// DESC: This program will take in a user input of integers and store them in an array
// This will then perform many operations on the array such as:
// Printing the array, finding the largest, smallest, sum, and average of the array
// There will also be an option to search for a number and check if it exists in the array
// It will also perform a bubble sort and print the sorted array


// This class is where all the array methods will be stored


package Assignment2;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class IntegerArray {
    // Class variables (static so they can be accessed anywhere without an object)
    static Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    static int[] array;
    static int arraySize;
